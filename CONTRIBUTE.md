### How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to your own copy of the codebase without affecting the original project until you're ready to submit.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work. This helps keep your changes isolated and easy to manage.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**  
   Work on your changes, and remember to:
   - Write clear, concise commit messages.
   - Follow the code style and conventions used in the project.
   - Write tests for any new features or bug fixes, if applicable.

4. **Test Your Changes**  
   Ensure that all existing and new tests pass. We aim to maintain a stable and high-quality codebase, so tests are essential.

5. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   When you're ready to share your changes, submit a pull request to the `dev` branch. Describe the purpose of the changes and any relevant context.

   - Make sure to include a clear description of what your change does.
   - If your contribution fixes a bug or implements a feature, reference the issue it addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123").
