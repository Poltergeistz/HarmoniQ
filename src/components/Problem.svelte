      Feeling Out of Sync with Your Workload?
    </h2>
    
    <p class="text-xl mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-indigo-800">
      As an entrepreneur, your ambitions are limitless. But when productivity seems to fluctuate—when focus fades, energy dips, and creativity feels out of reach—it can be frustrating.
    </p>

    <p class="text-xl mb-6 max-w-3xl mx-auto text-indigo-800">
      If you’ve ever blamed yourself for feeling <b>burnt out, unmotivated, or unable to concentrate</b>, the truth is: <b>it's not you, it's biology.</b> Hormonal shifts impact mental clarity, stamina, and even decision-making. Yet most productivity systems are built <b>as if every day is the same.</b>

      Why should your work schedule fight against your body’s natural rhythm? What if, instead, it worked with you?

      <p class="text-xl">
        Meet Emma. As a startup founder, Emma was constantly juggling meetings, deadlines, and creative tasks. She often felt overwhelmed, unsure why some days she felt energized and others drained. After tracking her cycle, Emma discovered that she felt her best and was most productive during the <strong>follicular phase</strong>—right after her period ends. During this time, her energy levels were at their highest, and her creativity soared.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl mt-4">
        Armed with this insight, Emma adjusted her schedule to align with her body's natural rhythm. She started focusing on big projects and brainstorming new ideas during her follicular phase, and scheduled meetings or admin work during times when she felt less energetic. The result? Emma felt more in control of her energy, was more productive, and was no longer frustrated by unpredictable dips in focus. She finally realized: her body had the answers all along.
